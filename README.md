Encryption is the process of translating plain text data (plaintext) into 
something that appears to be random and meaningless (ciphertext). 
Decryption is the process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext. To 
encrypt more than a small amount of data, symmetric encryption is 
used. A symmetric key is used during both the encryption and 
decryption processes. To decrypt a particular piece of ciphertext, the 
key that was used to encrypt the data must be used. The goal of every 
encryption algorithm is to make it as difficult as possible to decrypt the 
generated ciphertext without using the key
