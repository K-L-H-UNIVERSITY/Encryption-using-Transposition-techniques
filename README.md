Encryption is the process of translating plain text data (plaintext) into 
something that appears to be random and meaningless (ciphertext). 
Decryption is the process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext. To 
encrypt more than a small amount of data, symmetric encryption is 
used. A symmetric key is used during both the encryption and 
decryption processes. In cryptography, a transposition cipher is a method of encryption by 
which the positions held by units of plaintext (which are commonly 
characters or groups of characters) are shifted according to a regular 
system, so that the ciphertext constitutes a permutation of the plaintext. 
That is, the order of the units is changed (the plaintext is reordered). 
Mathematically a bijective function is used on the characters' positions 
to encrypt and an inverse function to decrypt.In cryptography, a 
transposition cipher is a method of encryption by which the positions 
held by units of plaintext (which are commonly characters or groups of 
characters) are shifted according to a regular system, so that the 
ciphertext constitutes a permutation of the plaintext.
